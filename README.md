**Graph Description-**

**Movies per Genre-** This chart illustrates the distribution of movies across different genre combinations in the dataset.
The visualization presents a comprehensive breakdown of movie counts by genre combinations, with genres listed on the y-axis and the count of movies (count_id) on the x-axis, ranging from 0 to 10 movies.
Key observations:

Pure "Drama" emerges as the most prevalent genre, with approximately 10 movies
Mixed genres involving Drama are notably common throughout the dataset:

"Crime, Drama, Thriller" ranks second with around 6-7 movies
"Adventure, Biography, Drama" follows with roughly 5 movies
"Drama, Family, Musical" shows approximately 4 movies

Notable patterns:

Drama appears as a component in most of the genre combinations, suggesting its fundamental role in storytelling
Genre hybridization is common, with most categories being combinations of 2-3 genres
Musical, Crime, and Biography frequently appear as secondary or tertiary genres
The distribution shows a clear tapering effect, with fewer movies in the more specific genre combinations

This demonstrates the prominence of Drama and its various combinations with other genres in the dataset.
